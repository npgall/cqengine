#labels Featured

===Version 2.0.0 - 2015-04-07===
 * New `TransactionalIndexedCollection` supports read-committed transaction isolation using Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

 * New support to generate attributes automatically as bytecode (see `AttributeBytecodeGenerator`)
 * `IndexedCollection` can now be located in off-heap memory, or persisted on disk (see `OffHeapPersistence` and `DiskPersistence`)
 * New indexes can be located in off-heap memory, or persisted on disk (see `OffHeapIndex` and `DiskIndex`)
 * Tested with an !IndexedCollections of 100 million objects
 * *CQEngine 2.0 contains some API changes since 1.3.2 - see the updated examples on the site for details*
 * Deployed to Maven central


===Version 1.3.2 - 2015-01-14===
 * Bugfix to `NavigableIndex`'s handling of range queries where the range values are exclusive and a quantizer is configured
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.3.1 - 2014-11-25===
 * Added new query types: `all()`, `none()`, and `regexMatches()`
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.2.7 - 2014-04-07===
 * Maintenance release
 * Bugfix for `ObjectLockingIndexedCollection.StripedLock`'s handling of negative hashcodes (issue 35)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.2.6 - 2014-01-07===
 * Maintenance release
 * Bugfix for deduplication MATERIALIZE strategy (issue 32)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.2.4 - 2013-11-22===
 * Maintenance release
 * Fixed _"!FilteringIterator.hasNext advances iterator every time it is called"_, with thanks to Gabe Hicks for patch (issue 23)
 * Fixed performance bottleneck in `Query.hashCode()`, with thanks to Atul Vasu for contribution (issue 25)
 * Fixed _"Set remove() and removeAll() doesn't follow substitutability principle"_, with thanks to Atul Vasu for patch (issue 27)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.2.2 - 2013-09-22===
 * Added `AttributesGenerator`, it is no longer necessary to write attributes by hand (issue 22)
 * See wiki page AttributesGenerator
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.2.1 - 2013-09-10===
 * Improved the toString representation of Query objects, query toStrings are now human readable (issue 19)
 * Bugfix in `SelfAttribute` (issue 21)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.2.0 - 2013-08-20===
 * Added support to sort results in ascending/descending order on an attribute-by-attribute basis, with thanks to Roberto Socrates for patch (issue 16)
 * Example usage: `cars.retrieve(query, queryOptions(orderBy(ascending(Car.DOORS), descending(Car.PRICE))))`
 * This release involves a minor *API change* from CQEngine 1.1.x, so is not a drop-in replacement
 * Code using the old API to order results such as `cars.retrieve(query, queryOptions(orderByDescending(Car.PRICE, Car.DOORS)))` should be changed to that above
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.1.1 - 2013-08-18===
 * Additional work on `ReflectiveAttribute` to play nicer with inherited fields (issue 18)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.1.0 - 2013-08-16===
 * Updated `RadixTreeIndex`, `ReversedRadixTreeIndex`, `InvertedRadixTreeIndex`, `SuffixTreeIndex` to use [http://code.google.com/p/concurrent-trees/wiki/ReleaseNotes concurrent-trees library 2.1] for lower memory usage and lower latency (issue 14)
 * Added `CQEngine.newObjectLockingInstance(int concurrencyLevel)` providing object-level locking on the write path for applications in which threads might race each other to add/remove the same object (issue 9)
 * Bugfix to hashCode implementation in Not.java, would reduce collisions if queries stored in hash maps (issue 13)
 * Added support to `SimpleAttribute` to specify generic types manually via constructor to bypass reflection (issue 17)
 * Bugfix to `ReflectiveAttribute` to allow it to access private fields (issue 18)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.0.3 - 2012-12-07===
 * Added new type of index, `UniqueIndex`, with thanks to Kinz Liu (issue 8) - can be used with primary-key type attributes to reduce memory usage and yield faster query performance
 * Added `ReflectiveAttribute` - reflection-based attribute, for trading performance for convenience/flexibility/simplifying dynamic queries in some cases (issue 6)
 * Added benchmarks for indexing overhead (issue 7)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.0.2 - 2012-11-22===
 * Added support for Has queries - `has(Car.DESCRIPTION)` and `not(has(Car.DESCRIPTION))` - the equivalent of SQL `IS NOT NULL` and `IS NULL` respectively. Use with `SimpleNullableAttribute`. These queries can be accelerated via `StandingQueryIndex`
 * Bugfix to updating compound indexes for objects added/removed after index added
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.0.1 - 2012-11-17===
 * Added support for customizing via factories, the construction of maps and sets used internally by `HashIndex`, `NavigableIndex` and `CompoundIndex` (concurrency level, load factor etc.) (issue 5)
 * Deployed to Maven central

===Version 1.0.0 - 2012-10-29===
 * Added support for attributes returning null values via `SimpleNullableAttribute`, `MultiValueNullableAttribute` (issue 2)
 * Bugfix to `ResultSet.uniqueResult()` (issue 4)
 * API same as in 0.9.1, no code changes necessary
 * Deployed to Maven central
